OSINT FOR HUMAN RACE HEALTH.OS stands for Open Source while INT stand for Intelligent System. If you have data available from public / labs / hospitals / doctors then you can analyze it in different ways for betterment of Human Health races.

(The United Nations, in a 1950 statement, opted to “drop the term ‘race’ altogether and speak of “ethnic groups”. In this case, there are more than 5,000 ethnic groups in the world, according to a 1998 study published in the Scientific American.
The word ‘RACE’ is used unintentionally in OSINT-HRH and requests you to treat it only as reference word for simplicity.)

What Is OSINT?
If you’ve heard the name but are wondering what it means, OSINT stands for open source intelligence, which refers to any information that can legally be gathered from free, public sources about an individual or organization. In practice, that tends to mean information found on the internet, but technically any public information falls into the category of OSINT whether it’s books or reports in a public library, articles in a newspaper or statements in a press release.
OS stands for Open Source while INT stand for Intelligent System.
If you have data available from public / labs / hospitals / doctors then you can analyze it in different ways for betterment of Human Health races.

The Vision:  To be a global Open source intelligent system that is available for free to all on Human Health diseases (Past+Present+Futures). It can be bridge between globally spread universities, labs, governments, pharmaceutical companies etc for analyzing and taking curative steps.

IT People + Biological People = Great OSINT 
What we want to achieve?
1.	User Friendly representation of data to common people on maps / data-tables/ graphs etc.
2.	A global open database that can be used by universities, labs, doctors etc on various diseases.
3.	A common global platform for keeping eye on diseases outbreaks and flow.
4.	 To Alarm a situation of disease based on numbers. This will help Governments to identify unknown geographical areas and take curative actions. 
5.	Low code system for freedom to create survey, Planning etc.
